do not make parallel function calls. Only call one function at a time.
Perform the following tasks in order:
 
0. Create a KIND Cluster file called kind-config.yaml that should be ingress ready for the node with role control-plane, have extra Port Mappings 80, 8080 and 443 (all TCP) for the same node mentioned previously and also have two extra roles called worker. After you have created the file, please identify the entire yaml object section that contains the ingress-ready string and output it. Then rewrite the created file by moving this section right below the line related to the control-plane role.

1. Download from https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/quick-start-with-kubernetes/ into the current directory all the yaml files present there, e.g. 00-role.yml

2. Add as a metadata entry for 00-account.yml the line 'namespace: ${TRAEFIK_NAMESPACE}'

3. Add for the 'subjects' object section in the 01-role-binding.yml the same line.

4. Add as a metadata entries for 02-traefik-services.yml the line 'namespace: ${TRAEFIK_NAMESPACE}'. Also substitute there LoadBalancer strings with NodePort.

5. Do the metadata entry routine also for ./02-traefik.yml. Also add here as an entry in the spec.template.spec the object:
    nodeSelector:
      ingress-ready: "true"
  To finish this step, add in the same place the object 'tolerations:' with the following keys:
    - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
    - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
  both using the Equal operator and NoSchedule effect.
